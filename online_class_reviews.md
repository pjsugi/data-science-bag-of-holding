# The best online classes I've taken, ordered by date of completion

Data Science courses from some of the best professors and institutions.

0. [Machine Learning - Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)  
  The classic first course in data science. Great introductory-level course to ML.
1. [Design of Computer Programs - Peter Norvig](https://www.udacity.com/course/design-of-computer-programs--cs212)  
  There are many python classes out there, but this is by far the most entertaining and useful class I've come across. Norvig is a master of solving tough problems using elegant Python code. The puzzles he works through are entertaining and challenging, covering proper use of data structures, testing, and much more. Good for anyone at beginner-intermediate level (beginners only if you are comfortable with at least one other programming language), but even grizzled python veterans might learn a thing or two.
2. [Algorithms - Tim Roughgarden](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms)  
  One of the best teachers I've had. Explained complex topics simply, yet rigorously, while having fun at the same time. Covers time/space complexity and an assorted of useful algorithms (sorting, graph traversals, greedy methods, dynamic programming, and more). 
3. [Natural Language Processing - Jurafsky and Manning](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/NLPCourseraSlides.html)  
  An excellent survey of NLP by two excellent teachers. Lectures and homeworks were pretty much identical to their Stanford undergraduate-level NLP course. However, no longer offered on Coursera.
4. Social Network Analysis - Lada Adamic  
  Fun introduction to representing (adjacency matrices, edge lists) and analyzing social graphs. Covers topics ranging from random network models, small world networks, communities, and diffusion of information. No longer offered on Coursera :(.
5. [Neural Networks for Machine Learning - Geoffrey Hinton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbeTc-Urqak&list=PLoRl3Ht4JOcdU872GhiYWf6jwrk_SNhz9)  
  Neural networks taught by the godfather of neural networks. No longer offered on Coursera, but lecture videos are on YouTube. The class was taught in 2014, and the field is moving so fast that many recent developments are missing, but worth watching to understand not just the basic concepts behind neural networks, but also to understand the history of how neural networks developed.
6. [Deep Learning for coders - Jeremy Howard](https://course.fast.ai/)  
  This was an interesting counterpoint in style to Hinton's class which heavily emphasized theory. Howard's philosophy is to start by ignoring theory and have students experiment first-hand with a deep learning framework. Once a practical understanding of how to construct a deep neural network and how to modify hyperparameters is obtained, he finishes the class by (lightly) digging into the theory.
7. [Causal Diagrams - Miguel Hernan](https://www.edx.org/course/causal-diagrams-draw-your-assumptions-before-your-conclusions)  
  This course is a great next step to take if, like me, you read [The Book of Why](book_reviews.md) and are still slightly confused by the rules of causal diagrams and want to dig deeper. The course clearly explains many of the same concepts as Pearl's book, but provides many more examples (along with excellent diagrams), and also goes deeper into many topics (e.g. how to handle uncertainty, dealing with time).

  Every post contains an incredibly clear explanation of a complicated topic in ML. For example, [causal inference techniques](http://blog.echen.me/2014/08/15/propensity-modeling-causal-inference-and-discovering-drivers-of-growth/), [summary of Netflix prize-winning techniques](http://blog.echen.me/2011/10/24/winning-the-netflix-prize-a-summary/), and [gaussian mixture modeling](http://blog.echen.me/2012/03/20/infinite-mixture-models-with-nonparametric-bayes-and-the-dirichlet-process/). Unfortunately, not updated recently.

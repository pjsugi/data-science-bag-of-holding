# Interesting presentations and talks

- [I Don't Like Notebooks - Joel Grus (at JupyterCon 2018!)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1n2RlMdmv1p25Xy5thJUhkKGvjtV-dkAIsUXP-AL4ffI/)  
  Hilarious summary of the bad parts of notebooks (footnotes are a must read). Basically, they have nasty gotchas (hidden states), encourage bad habits, discourage good habits, hinder reproduciblity and collaboration, and more. Well worth a skim no matter what side of the debate you are on.

- More to come
